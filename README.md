# Git Is Fun

## This is not exactly my first repo but my first while on this training EANBiT2019 

### I will write useful shortcuts for markdown in here for future use

OK. Now I will not write the short cuts. I will just write stuff, a story may be.

## FIRST DAY OF THE RESIDENTIAL TRAINING

This is my to do list
1. Wake up
2. Get ready
3. Choose outfit

This is the dress I want to wear.

But sadly it's not suitable for this occasion.

My mother's voice...

> You cannot dress like that to work. You need a suite and a coat.
Have you taken breakfast

So, I will choose another dress! Sad. may be skirt and top. And then go back to my list of to do's!

Not in order:
- fix breakfast
* dress up
- go to class

This space is now for serious business.

* Oh also these days I'm into programing. 

Here is some python code just for fun.

```python
if dnacheck(dna):
        dna_len= len(dna)
        gs = dna.count('G')
        cs = dna.count('C')
        
        return (gs+cs)/dna_len*100
```

Alright.

That's it. BYE :)
